# MDL Webpack2
A [Google Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/index.html) project built with NPM and Webpack2 using SASS and EcmaScript 2015/2016.

>Move mdl-webpack project to Webpack2.
>Work in progress.<br/>
>**Note:** This project vill move to `mdl-webpack` when completed!

## Consider
* Swap MDL layout with a pure flexbox layout
* Use [modularscale-sass](https://github.com/modularscale/modularscale-sass) i favour of MDL typography
